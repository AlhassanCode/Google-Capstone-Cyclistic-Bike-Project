In this cas-study, I will perform some real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. 
I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and 
team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps 
of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
I will attempt to answer the business problem: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
