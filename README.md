# CASE STUDY 1: HOW DOES A BIKE-SHARE NAVIGATE SPEEDY SUCCESS ?

## Background of Study

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. 
Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo 
bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't
use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% 
of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, 
but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. The director of marketing believes the 
company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, 
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.



In this cas-study, I will perform some real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. 
I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and 
team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps 
of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
I will attempt to answer the business problem: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
